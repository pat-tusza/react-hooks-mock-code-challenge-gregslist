## Instructions

Welcome to gregslist, a community site for finding free items near you.

The designers have put together the components and CSS. Now it's up to you to
bring the features to life by adding stateful logic as well as persisting data
to the backend via our API.

Your job will be to make our app work according to the user stories you will
find the [Core Deliverables](#Core-Deliverables) section.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Run `npm start`. This will open both your React page on port 6002 and your
   backend on port 6001.

## Core Deliverables

As a user:

1. When the app starts, I can see all listings. ðŸ¥¸
  
  Fetch request to API (db.json) in App.js
  Save data in useEffect 
  Pass arry of object down to ListingContainer
  Map data 
  Pass Mapped Data 
  Plug in data in Card


2. I can "favorite" and "unfavorite" a listing on the frontend by clicking the
   star icon. This feature doesn't need backend persistence.
   
   useState to toggle on and off 
   onClick event Listener w/ handleclick fucntion


3. I can remove a listing from the page by clicking the trash can icon. This
   change should be persisted in the backend.

   Create a function for a delete fetch in ListingContainer
   add event listner to trash button 



4. I can search for listings by their name.

    onChange useState on the search bar

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

You'll have to add additional elements for these features. Feel free to style
them however you see fit!

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user:

1. I can sort the listings alphabetically by location.
    


2. I can create a new listing by submitting a form, and persist the changes to
   the backend.
